# 🐍 python_playground

Welcome to the **python_playground** repository:
a collection of useful, quirky, and practical Python scripts. This repo serves as a sandbox of Python functions written for a variety of tasks, ranging from data extraction to automation, DevOps, and QoL utilities.

## 🧰 What's Inside?

This is not a structured package or framework — it's a personal and growing toolbox of Python snippets and scripts. Some things you’ll find here:

- 🛠 **Automation Scripts**: 
  - File and folder organization
  - Bulk renaming
  - Task schedulers
- ☁️ **DevOps Helpers**:
  - Kubernetes utilities
  - Docker helpers
  - GitLab and CI/CD snippets
- 📊 **Data Extraction**:
  - Parsing logs
  - Reading and extracting info from CSV, Excel, and other file types
- ⚙️ **Macros & Miscellaneous**:
  - Helpful one-liners
  - Script templates
  - API call helpers

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Evgeny-Nik/python_playground.git
   cd python_playground
    ```

2. Run or adapt any script to your needs:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. Customize and experiment, that's the point of the playground!

## 📂 File Structure

Files are mostly standalone scripts. There is no enforced module structure, but function names and filenames aim to be descriptive.

> **Note:** Some scripts may require specific Python packages. Dependencies (if any) will usually be listed in a comment at the top of the file.

## 📌 Contributions

This is a personal sandbox, but feel free to fork and modify it for your own needs. If you find something useful or want to contribute an idea, feel free to open an issue or PR.

Happy scripting! ✨
